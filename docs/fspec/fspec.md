##Overview
We are creating a "Guess Who" game. We will be using characters from movies, TV shows, video games, and whatever else we decide to dive into. Our goal is to have people be able to play this game with their friends online, and on their phones. However we are not limiting ourselves to just playing the game, but we want people to be able to spectate other peoples games!

###Disclaimer/Revision History
This document only discusses what the user will see and interact with throughout the web application. It does not discuss any low-level implementation specifics however gives a front-end high-level perspective. We took into consideration the copy write issues with our logo and decided to talk to the companies to strike a deal with them. Also all of our designs are strictly preliminary and can change as we sit fit as we get into the actual design. We also did not cover all of the scenarios that the user can experience in gameplay because of the amount there could be. So only the main scenarios were covered to give more than enough detail to explain how the game works.

##Scenarios

###How to play
The blue chat box was blinking and going down, so User asked a question, after (s)he hit enter his/her timer stopped blinking and a red timer lit up and started going down. Once his/her partner had responded his/her timer lit up again. So User started clicking the pictures that could no longer be his/her partner. Once (s)he finished clicking pictures his/her timer stopped blinking and his/her partners started once more. Next his partner asked a question, once User looked at his/her picture (s)he responded truthfully, and his/her partners timer lit up again.

###Benny
Benny is a new user. Benny decided to click a link to “Guess Who”. When he clicked the page we decided to click Guest. There was a prompt that warned Benny he would not be able to track his stats. He clicked that he was sure and did not want to create a new account. Once he did this a screen popped up and said “searching for challenge”  after a few moments a new page popped up. There was a prompt to pick a person and many people to choose from. He clicked a person, when clicked he saw a larger picture of this person and a prompt asking if he was sure that this was the person he wanted. After he clicked yes the page changed. Benny could see the same people he could choose from and his picture on the right side of the screen. under the list of people he could see a chat box, and two timers next to the chat box. *Refer to how to play.* This continued Until Benny said “Is your person Bill?” His partner responded with “Yes”. Once this happened there was a pop-up. Benny had 3 choices, continue, create new account, or done for now. He clicked create new account. He was prompted to enter his email address, a username, a password, re enter his password, his DOB, and a security code. He then confirmed his information, opened his email and entered the confirmation code, once he had done this he was brought back to the sign in.

As the game goes on the person realizes that Team Rocket is cheating. They click the “Report User” button in the bottom right corner and they’re prompted “Are You Sure You Wish to Report this User.” They click “Yes.” They then proceed to quit because they are sick of the cheating.
