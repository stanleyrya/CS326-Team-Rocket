Project Summary
===============
We are creating a "Guess Who" game. Our goal is to have people be able to play this game with their friends online, and on their phones. However we are not limiting ourselves to just playing the game, but we want people to be able to spectate other peoples games! Our original game will be a Pokemon database, but we hope to be able to add databases from movies, TV shows, video games and even take suggestions from our frequent users to make the game better as time goes on. This makes sure our users don't get bored with the same characters over and over again like the original board game.
