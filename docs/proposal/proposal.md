##Timeline:
Preliminary Research						September 15th - October 15th

	Our preliminary research stage starts with testing the original “Guess Who” game. To properly complete this project we will have to not only be familiar with the gameplay but also become obsessed with it. Other small research includes possible copyright infringements, useful outside libraries, and databases of people and other noteworthy characters.
	
Design Documents						October 1st - October 15th
	Design documents will be vital for a smooth start in the coding stage.
	
Coding								October 15th - November 30th
	The coding process will produce a prototype of the game by November 1st, a working system and website for the game by November 15th, and a complete product by November 30th.
	
Front-End/Graphics						November 1st - November 30th
	Graphics for the system, game, and characters will most likely evolve with the project over time. Draft copies will be produced by November 10th, followed by final draft copies November 20th. The extra time is allotted incase it becomes necessary.
	
Polishing/Debugging						November 20th - December 4th
	Polishing and Debugging officially starts November 20th, however testing will be produced on a smaller scale all throughout the coding process.
	
Final Deadline							December 4th
	This is non-negotiable.
	
Backburner:
	If time permits, we would like to extend our product past the base idea.
1. Create multiple databases and extensions for unique characters
2. Adapt the UI to work with touchscreen devices
3. Create an Android and/or iOS application that works with our game

##The Problem Statement
Nostalgia. It’s a word many adults, of college age or older, feel keenly as they move further from their childhood. People suffering from this emotion often look for things to do from their childhood and modern technology has greatly helped in this quest as the afflicted download and buy modern versions of the “classic” games of their youth. One of the games we haven’t been able to find a good/modern version of in stores or online is Guess Who and that doesn’t get rid of that horrible Nostalgic feeling that eats away at you.
Team Rocket blasts off and into this project with a group of people whose past experiences will allow our project to come into fruition. For the artwork and general layout of the game, History of Comic Art, History of Animation, Intro to Media and Culture, and Psych 100 will provide cultural and psychological design background that can be implemented using the software learned in Art 271. Additionally, more than one member of the group have taken multiple courses in Economics which will help with budgeting and marketing. We plan on using our Computer Science 230 and 125, Philosophy classes, and Programming in Python for the new ways of thinking that supplement what we have learned in our JAVA programming courses 121, 187, and 220. Networking, another computer science course, will be useful in allowing two players to go head to head while Computer Science 305 and College writing will help us craft the documentation that accompanies such a project. Furthermore, several of our members have taken or are taking Computer Science 320, the Software Engineering course that not only increases your knowledge of Java, but also teaches you how to get along and program in a team to complete an assignment. Both the teamwork and leadership skills learned in this class will be invaluable, and the experience in documentation cannot hurt either.
In short, our group’s knowledge is extensive, diverse, and fully capable of tackling the problem that faces almost every person our age.

##The Product
The Guess Who? web application is an easily accessible, modern-day browser game based on the iconic guessing game of the 80’s. A player who arrives at the website will automatically be assigned a humorous username and passed into a matchmaking queue with little fuss.
Once another opponent has been found, the players will see an interface similar to the image below. Keep in mind that this interface is in its early alpha stages and will be updated as needed based upon the capabilities of the artist as well as critiques from beta testers. The players’ persons of interest will show up on the right-hand side of the screen. Players will then take turns asking yes or no questions about the opponent’s person of interest via the chat client, and the opponent will answer. The player then manually selects the icons eliminated based on the opponent’s answer until only one person remains. Whoever can correctly guess the others’ person of interest first wins the game.
Early Alpha Interface

This web application provides easy accessibility to anyone looking for a little ‘90s nostalgia without having to make a trip to a game store. The lightweight, 0-commitment design allows for a quick pvp match without the fuss of assembly, disassembly, or broken pieces. No longer will consumers search in vain for this elusive childhood game--the game is literally a click away!
