Discussion:

Finished up assignment 3. Specifically, finished the scenarios, created non-goals, converted everything into the proper format,
double checked that we have not missed any requirements. Also caught up with meeting notes, which had not been updated for two
weeks. Oops.

Task:
--------
 - Non-goals			                    Ryan Stanley
 - Scenarios 	                        Matt Downes
 - Uploading used images to github    Kelly Finn
 - Updating team notes				        Jade Hedrick/Finn
 - Slideshow					                Joey D'Agostino

Issues:
----------
Jade did not attend the last meeting where the bulk of the work was done and could not contribute as heavily as other team
members due to lack of context.
