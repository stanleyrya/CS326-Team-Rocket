Started workshop 3. Finn left at 4pm, Ryan showed up a 4pm and left at 7pm, Jade left at 6pm. Most of the "work" was not code
but rather speculation of the format of the assignment. Basic understanding of what was expected of us was established. Index
was completely implemented and tested. 

Task:
--------
-Develop a general understanding of what the assignment is asking from us and sketch out a vague implementation of all three 
javascript files.

-Implement index.

Issues:
----------
No more than two people were working on it at a time. Only three people in total attended.
