Discussion:

Crunch time. At this point index was implemented and debugged, while client and server had tentative semi-pseudocode 
implementation.  Matt had to leave earlier, but we continued on until we ran into some issues with the asynchronous 
nature of javascript. No coherent notes, just the remnants of a crazy woman's mad rambling on a whiteboard, courtesy of Jade.

Task:
--------
-Successfully querey the database with server

-Successfully read the server's response with client

Issues:
----------
We did not get it working correctly. Code fatigue hit hard. Therapeutic visit to Pita Pit afterwards.
