# Project Overview

We are creating a "Guess Who" game. 
We will be using characters from movies, TV shows, video games, and whatever else we decide to dive into. 
Our goal to have people be able to play this game with their friends online, and on their phones. 
However we are not limiting ourselves to just playing the game, 
but we want people to be able to spectate other peoples games!

# Original Proposal
 - You should review the notes directory to find all of our team meeting notes.
 - You should review the proposal file to find our proposal including all of the important information.
 - You should ignore the "Finn's Testing" and "test2" files for they were done for testing reasons.
 
# Functional Specification
 - You should review the notes directory to find all of our team meeting notes, even the ones we forgot!
 - You should review the docs/fspec directory to find all relevant files regarding functional specification.
 - You should ignore the "Finn's Testing" and "test2" files for they were done for testing reasons.
