Project 1:
Few missing things here:
  - You are missing your company logo
  - The project required you to make a docs directory, please see the assignment for details

The application looks good and I look forward to seeing it evolve over the course of the semester. There is a great deal 
of humor here (obvious pokemon references) and you guys certainly reflect this in the description, slogan, and your own 
bios.

Your trello board is currently very inactive, please keep in mind its a requirement for the class to utilize the board, 
I'd like to see more activity.
[Weak Thumbs Up]

Project 2:
I like the bit of creativity with the icon, however in the real world you'd be facing lawsuits for using these pictures.
(Unless you plan on striking a deal with the owners!)

Nice work on the details of the project, the problem statement, and relating the group's expirences to the project itself.
The timeline looks good, the cost estimates are a little off but its good you are considering things like food/drink expenses
as they certainly are.

Your trello board activity went up which is nice to see, but I'd like to see you guys meeting more often, understandable that
we are in the mid semester and exams are coming up but try to meet for at least an hour each week as you will find it really
helps bring the project together.
[Thumbs Up]

Project 4:
This all looks really good and understandable as a draft for what to work towards for the assignment. I encourage you to keep
iterating on the page layouts as you go as you'll find better ways of handling the overall designs.
[Thumbs Up]
